Open the Extensions view in _**VS Code**_ (press _**Ctrl + Shift + X**_).<br>
Search for _**Live Server**_ and click **_"Install"_**.<br>
After installation, right-click on the **_HTML_** file and choose the option **_"Open with Live Server"_**. The **_HTML_** file will automatically open in your browser.<br>
If you already have the extension configured, a button to open the file in the browser may appear in the top-right corner of the editor.
